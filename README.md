# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-using-Recurrent-Neural-Networks-LSTM-
In my Bitcoin price prediction project, I utilized 10 years of historical data to conduct a comprehensive time series forecasting analysis. I calculated the average price per year and decomposed the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components to uncover underlying patterns. I also determined the correlation between Bitcoin's price and its trading volume, and performed a volatility analysis to assess market fluctuations. Building on these insights, I developed an LSTM model that used the previous 60 timesteps to predict the next day’s open price, effectively capturing the temporal dynamics of Bitcoin’s market behavior.
